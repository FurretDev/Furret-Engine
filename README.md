# Furret Engine

Furret Engine is an FNF Engine like any other engine out there.



## Features

- Haxe Scripts support.
- FNF inputs
- Note splashes
- Middlescroll
- In-built stage editor (Coming soon)


## Installation

If you want to modify the game. You'll have to install Haxe 4.2.5 and Visual Studio 2019 Community. Follow a Friday Night Funkin'/HaxeFlixel compilation tutorial

If you want to "just add a few songs". Download the engine from the releases tab.
